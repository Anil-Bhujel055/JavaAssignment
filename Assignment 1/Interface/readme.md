# Default Method in Interface:

Interface could only have abstract method before java.So implementation of a new method done in interface have to be provided in implementingclass too.So to overcome the problem, default method are implemented.

For Example:

[default_interface_example](https://github.com/Anil-Bhujel055/JavaAssignment/blob/master/Interface/DefaultInterface.java)


# Inheritance in Interface:
	
The process of inheriting a interface by another interface as it is done in the class is called inheritance in 
interface.
Multiple inheritance is possible in interface.

For example:
	[inheritance-example](https://github.com/Anil-Bhujel055/JavaAssignment/blob/master/Interface/Inheritance.java)


# Nested Interface:

The process of definng a interface inside another interface or a class is called nested interface.

-a object of nested interface can be made by its outer interface or the class that its implements.
